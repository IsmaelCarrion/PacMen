# PacMen

The game or program allows the user to add one or more PacMen to the browser and then set them in motion across the screem up and down and from side to side. 

## This is a project that has a basic interface consisting of two buttons: 

- Add PacMan: when the user press this button a new a pacman appears in the screem.

- Star Game: when the user press this button al the PacMen in the screen start moven up and down and from side to side.

## What is used in this program to make it work?

The program uses the following:

- images directory: in this directory are store all the images that are used to move the PacMen across the screen.
- java script file: the java script file has many function that dynamically create the PacMen (images) and adds them to the dom. There is an array cons used to store the packmen and dinamically update their position in the screen acording to their speed and image acording to where in the screen the PacMan is. 
- index.html file: this is the file used to show the PacMen in the browser, it uses the javascript file and its functions. 

## How to run/execute the program. 

To execute the program in your local machine you need to download the following files: Index.html, pacmen.js and images directory. You can open the source code using any text editor, but it is better viewed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## What's next?

- Refactoring of the code to improve its efficiency.
- Additional interface to control the PacMen speed and direction in the screen.
- change the color of the PacMen using a function that generates a ramdon color.
